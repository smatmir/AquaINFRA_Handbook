# The European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)

The **European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)** is an initiative by the European Commission to provide researchers with a unified, trusted virtual environment for storing, analyzing, and sharing data across borders and disciplines.

For AquaINFRA users, EOSC is the overarching infrastructure that makes our multidisciplinary approach possible, providing the underlying framework for FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data sharing.

## 🌍 Understanding the EOSC Initiative

The **European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)** is a primary initiative under the EU’s Policy of Open Science and a key pillar of the European Data Strategy. Its core mission is to champion research data management, ensuring that European scientists can fully leverage the benefits of data-driven science.

### Main Goals
- **Global Leadership**: Establish the EU as a global leader in research data management.
- **Reducing Fragmentation**: Unify the European research landscape by providing a standardized way to access and process data.
- **Seamless Access & Reliable Re-use**: Provide researchers across borders and disciplines with a trusted, open ecosystem for research data and digital outputs.

### Benefits for Researchers
- **FAIR Data**: Champions the FAIR principles, making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.
- **Interoperable Services**: Offers a suite of services that fluidly facilitate data hosting, processing, and management.
- **Infrastructure Federation**: Allows various scientific research infrastructures like AquaINFRA to federate, sharing resources and knowledge securely and efficiently.

## 🚀 The EOSC EU Node: Your Starting Point

The [EOSC EU Node](https://open-science-cloud.ec.europa.eu/) is the first operational deployment of this infrastructure, designed to help you get started quickly and securely.

### Accessing the Platform

You do not need a new account. The system automatically recognizes your institutional identity:
- **EduGAIN**: For university and research institution staff.
- **EU Login**: For European Commission staff.
- **eIDAS**: For users with national electronic IDs.

> [!NOTE]
> **Access & Credits**
> Upon logging in, you are assigned an access level based on your institutional role. This level grants you **virtual credits** from the European Commission, which replenish every 90 days, enabling you to use cloud services free of charge.

### What Can You Do?

Your personal **User Space** dashboard provides direct access to tools tailored for research workflows:

1.  **Deploy Core Services**: Access secure cloud storage, interactive notebooks, large file transfers, virtual machines, and container platforms.
2.  **Use the Tools Hub**: Instantly launch pre-configured analysis and visualization tools using your allocated credits, without manual setup.
3.  **Collaborate in Groups**: "Investigator" level users can create groups (which receive 6,000 pooled credits) to coordinate projects, share data, and manage joint access to tools across a research team.

> [!TIP]
> **Getting Started**
> To begin leveraging these European-scale computational resources for your aquatic research, navigate directly to the **[EOSC EU Node Support Page](https://open-science-cloud.ec.europa.eu/support/getting-started-eosc-eu-node)**.
