# Introduction AquaINFRA

The **AquaINFRA project** (2023–2026) is developing a next-generation virtual environment equipped with **FAIR** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) multidisciplinary data and services.

Our mission is to support marine and freshwater scientists and stakeholders in **restoring healthy oceans, seas, coastal, and inland waters** by bridging the gap between isolated research infrastructures and national borders.

### Core Objectives:

- **Marine-Freshwater Integration**: Breaking silos to enable joint collaboration across the entire land-sea continuum.
- **EOSC-Based Infrastructure**: Building a cross-country discovery mechanism as part of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC).
- **Spatio-temporal Analysis**: Providing standardized services for biological, chemical, and physical data modeling.
- **Reproducible Science**: Ensuring that every analytical workflow can be shared, reused, and validated by the community.

### Project Methodology: Official Architecture

The AquaINFRA ecosystem connects disparate data sources through a unified analytical pipeline, ensuring interoperability with the **Digital Twin of the Ocean (DTO)** and **EOSC** components.

# The AquaINFRA Virtual Research Environment

The **AquaINFRA Virtual Research Environment (VRE)** is a modular and extensible platform built on established open-source technologies. It serves as the analytical engine of the project, enabling researchers to run complex workflows through a user-friendly interface.

### Key Technologies

- **[Galaxy Platform](https://aqua.usegalaxy.eu/)**: A powerful web-based gateway for accessible and reproducible genomic and spatial analysis.
- **[Aqua Interaction Platform (AIP)](https://aquainfra.dev.52north.org/)**: Seamlessly search and discover data across Earth observations and European hydrography.
- **Binder & OGC API**: Integrated services for interactive computing and standardized data processing.
- **Language Support**: Native support for **R** and **Python** environments.

### Why use the VRE?

1. **FAIR Processing**: Workflows developed in our case studies are published as **D2KP** with full provenance.
2. **Cross-Domain Discovery**: Discover aquatic digital resources across disciplines and national borders.
3. **High-Performance Computing**: Access the resources needed for large-scale spatio-temporal modeling.

> [!TIP]
> Visit the [AquaINFRA VRE Portal](https://aquainfra.dev.52north.org/) to explore community-tailored tools and start your first analysis.
