# The AquaINFRA Virtual Research Environment

The **AquaINFRA Virtual Research Environment (VRE)** provides researchers in the aquatic sciences with a powerful, open platform for reproducible data analysis and workflow sharing.

Designed to support FAIR and open data principles, the VRE is fully integrated with the AquaINFRA Interaction Platform (AIP) and connected to the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). 

## 📽️ Video Tutorial: Getting Started

Learn how to use the VRE, subset data, and import it directly into your analysis history in Galaxy.

## Core Features & Workflow

Built on the **Galaxy platform**, **Binder**, and **OGC API processes**, the VRE enables users to access, process, and publish data using a flexible, user-friendly canvas that supports widely used programming languages such as **R** and **Python**.

Researchers can:
1. **Run Workflows**: Execute workflows developed in AquaINFRA’s case studies.
2. **Modify & Extend**: Tailor existing workflows to meet specific research needs.
3. **Publish Outputs**: Share results and analyses via **D2KP** with full data provenance.

> [!TIP]
> **Extensibility**
> While Galaxy is currently the core component of the VRE, it offers a robust foundation for future integration of additional tools. A dedicated subdomain ensures that tools are tailored to the AquaINFRA user community, combining ease of access with powerful analytical capabilities.
