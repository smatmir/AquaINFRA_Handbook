# The Gulf of Riga & Daugava River Case Study

<div style="font-size: 1.2rem; color: var(--text-secondary); margin-bottom: 2rem;">Exploring long-term optical changes in a semi-enclosed marine environment.</div>

<div class="callout callout--info">
    <strong><span class="badge">GOAL</span> Research Question</strong>
    Do the optical properties in the Gulf of Riga change over the long term (darkening hypothesis)?
</div>

## The Origin Story {#origin-story}

The research question for this use case began with a personal observation from scuba divers at the **Latvian Institute of Aquatic Ecology**.

They jokingly noted that the underwater world in the Gulf of Riga seemed to be becoming "darker" over the years.

<div class="callout">
    <strong>Anecdote</strong>
    "One explanation they joked is that they are simply getting older... but even so, the observation raised a serious hypothesis."
</div>

This led to the core research question: **Do the optical properties in the Gulf of Riga change over the long term?**

## Study Area Characteristics {#study-area}

The **Gulf of Riga** is a unique marine environment with specific challenges:

*   **Shallow & Semi-enclosed**<br>
    Exchanges water slowly with the open Baltic Sea.
*   **River Impact**<br>
    Strongly impacted by runoffs from the **Daugava River** and land-based activities.
*   **Seasonality**<br>
    Heavily influenced by spring nutrient inputs, summer algal blooms, and winter ice conditions.

## The Approach {#approach}

To answer the question, the team developed a reproducible **DGA (Data Gathering and Analysis) workflow** as part of AquaINFRA.
