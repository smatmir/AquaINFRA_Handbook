# AquaINFRA Interaction Platform (AIP)

The **[AquaINFRA Interaction Platform (AIP)](https://aquainfra.dev.52north.org/)** serves as the central gateway for scientific communities to find, access, and reuse aquatic digital resources.

## Search Functionality
*   **Usage**: In the search bar, users can enter terms (e.g., "Gulf of Riga") to find relevant workflows, data, and tools.
*   **Ontology Search**: Categorizes results based on their semantic relationship to the search term, helping users explore related concepts.

## Filtering Results
The platform offers robust filtering to narrow down resources:

### 1. By Data Provider
Filter resources from specific trusted providers, including:
*   INSPIRE
*   Arctic Data Center
*   Copernicus Marine
*   HELCOM
*   EMODnet

### 2. By Spatial Coverage
An **Interactive Map** allows for spatial filtering:
*   Select specific **European Catchment Areas**.
*   Draw a **Custom Bounding Box** directly on the map to find data within a specific region of interest.
