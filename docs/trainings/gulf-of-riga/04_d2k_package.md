# Data-to-Knowledge Package

The **Data-to-Knowledge Package (D2K)** is a core concept in AquaINFRA. It links data and computational code to support reproducible spatiotemporal trend detection analysis.

## What is it?
A D2K package is specifically designed to structure and integrate meta-objects, providing a framework for addressing specific research questions—in this case: *"Do the optical properties in the Gulf of Riga change over the long term?"*

## Contents of the Package
Within the package, you will find:
*   **Step-by-step Guide**: Instructions on how to run the workflow.
*   **Virtual Lab**: Links to a MyBinder-based virtual lab.
*   **Web API Services**: Detailed info on developed services.

### Virtual Lab
The virtual lab provides a computational environment based on reproducible source code and data. It offers users a ready-to-use setup with pre-installed packages.

### Toolbox & Reproducibility
The package includes a toolbox of predefined functions for:
*   Data processing
*   Statistical assessment
*   Visualization

This acts as the computational backbone, supporting long-term trend identification.
