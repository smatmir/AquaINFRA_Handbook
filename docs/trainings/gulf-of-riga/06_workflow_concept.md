# Gulf of Riga Workflow Concept

Before running the analysis, it is important to understand the conceptual design of the **Gulf of Riga DGA Workflow**.

## Overview
This workflow is designed to detect spatiotemporal trends in optical properties (Secchi depth) over long periods.

## Workflow Structure
The workflow consists of several key stages:
1.  **Input Data**: In-situ measurements and assessment regions.
2.  **Pre-processing**: Spatial and temporal aggregation of data points.
3.  **Analysis**: Statistical trend detection using Mann-Kendall tests.
4.  **Visualization**: Generation of maps and charts.

## Accessibility
The workflow is available in the **AquaINFRA Interaction Platform** and can be imported directly into the **Aqua Galaxy** VRE. This ensures that the analysis is not only performant but also fully reproducible by other scientists.
