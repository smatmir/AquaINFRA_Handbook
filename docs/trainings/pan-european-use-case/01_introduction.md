# 1. Introduction to AquaINFRA and the Use-case

The **AquaINFRA** project is developing a virtual environment designed to assist marine and freshwater scientists and stakeholders in restoring healthy aquatic ecosystems, including oceans, seas, and coastal and inland waters.

## The Virtual Environment
This environment features **FAIR** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) multidisciplinary data and services. It enables stakeholders to:
*   **Store, share, and access** research data.
*   **Analyze and process** digital research objects.
*   **Collaborate** across scientific fields and national borders.

By leveraging the **European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)** and other existing operational data spaces, AquaINFRA facilitates seamless cross-domain research.

## The Pan-European Use Case
A key focus of AquaINFRA is enabling collaboration between researchers in the marine and freshwater domains. This is tested through strategic use cases, including the **Pan-European Use Case** highlighted in this training.

The primary goal of this use case is to include fragmented datasets to provide **more robust estimates of biodiversity** all across Europe.
