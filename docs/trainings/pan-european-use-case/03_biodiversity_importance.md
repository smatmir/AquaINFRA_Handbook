# 3. Importance of Freshwater Biodiversity

Biodiversity forms the foundation of healthy ecosystems. Understanding it has become a central focus of international frameworks, such as:
*   **UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 15)**: Life on Land (which includes protecting inland freshwater ecosystems).
*   **Convention on Biological Diversity**: Global commitments to safeguard the diversity of life.

## The Sensitivity of Freshwater Ecosystems
Freshwater biodiversity is among the most threatened on the planet. Ecosystems like rivers and lakes host species that are **highly sensitive to environmental change**. Their decline serves as an early warning signal for broader ecological disruptions.

## Research Focus & Bioindicators
To understand how human impacts drive biodiversity, researchers use specific organisms as **bioindicators**:
*   **Fish**: Long-lived indicators of habitat connectivity and water quality.
*   **Macro-invertebrates**: Sensitive to pollution and local habitat changes.

### The Danube River Case Study
The Danube River acts as an "important living laboratory" for this research. It supports iconic and characteristic species like:
*   **Danube Sturgeon**
*   **Huchen (Danube Salmon)**
Both are powerful indicators of river health and are currently considered endangered.
