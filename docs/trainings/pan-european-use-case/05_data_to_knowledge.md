# 5. Data to Knowledge (D2K) Package

To access the resources developed for this use case, navigate to the **AquaINFRA Interaction Platform** and search for "Data to Knowledge Package."

## The Toolkit
Select the package titled: **"Data to Knowledge Package for Specleaner: A toolkit for ensemble outlier detection and removal."** This package ensures all components are **FAIR** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).

## Package Sections
The D2K package is structured into five key sections:

### 1. Virtual Research Environment (Workflow)
Clicking here provides detailed documentation and redirects you to **Galaxy** (the execution environment) or **Zenodo** (the data repository).

### 2. Virtual Lab (Binder)
Redirects to a **MyBinder** environment where you can interact directly with the **R and Python code** and explore the underlying Docker image in your browser.

### 3. Web API (pygeoapi)
Lists all API services linked to the workflow. The Pan-European processes are found under the identifier **"Boku"**.

### 4. Reproducible Basis
Contains the complete toolbox, including scripts and tools hosted permanently on **GitHub** and **Zenodo**.

### 5. Datasets
Provides information and **direct download links** for the input datasets required (e.g., the GeoJSON area of interest).
