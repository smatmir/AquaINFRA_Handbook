# 10. Conclusion and Final Remarks

The Pan-European Biodiversity Workflow is a powerful demonstration of how the AquaINFRA Virtual Environment simplifies complex, multi-domain research.

## Key Takeaways
*   **Applicability**: Although developed for the Pan-European use case, this workflow is applicable **all around the world**, not just in Europe.
*   **Accessibility**: It targets both **proficient coders** (who want to save time) and **non-proficient users** (who can access advanced R scripts through a simple interface).
*   **Fairness**: The entire process ensures that data, tools, and models are FAIR, leading to greater transparency and reproducibility in biodiversity insights.

## Our Friends in the Background
As we conclude, remember the species that drive this work. Protecting the **Danube Sturgeon** and the **Huchen (Danube Salmon)** means protecting the ecological balance of our river systems.

## Final Remarks from the Team
The AquaINFRA team hopes this workflow supports your research and encourages further exploration of our tools and services. Together, let's make data-driven research FAIR and more impactful.
